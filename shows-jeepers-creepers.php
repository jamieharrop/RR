          <p><img src="images/jeepers-creepers1.jpg" class="alignleft" width="300" />My first play for the stage had its world premiere at the Leicester Square Theatre in January 2016. Based on my biography of Marty Feldman, it relates the successes and struggles the comedian and his supportive and ambitious wife, Lauretta, encountered in Hollywood. Directed by Terry Jones, Jeepers Creepers starred David Boyle and Rebecca Vaughan.</p>

          <p>The play ran from 18 January to 20 February 2016</p>
