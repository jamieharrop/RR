          <p>I started writing 'Cor!' magazine, my enthusiastic comedy fanzine, as a tribute to Bernard Bresslaw. After a few years my commitment to writing books meant I had less and less time for it, and sadly 'Cor!' came to an abrupt end after a fun fourteen issues. However, I've recently discovered a very limited supply of back issues and they are now up for grabs ~ at a fiver each, plus postage &amp; packing! Classic comedy never dates, and the contemporary material now has an air of history about it; so basically, these are the fanzine equivalent of 'Goodnight Sweetheart'. Anyway, if you're interested please e~mail: <a href="mailto:robert@robertross.co.uk">robert@robertross.co.uk</a>, but get 'em while they're hot. Once these are gone there'll be no more re~prints.</p>
