              <p>Ford's Theatre, Washington. Friday, 14th April, 1865. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. The place, the date and the event which made history. Or did it? Someone has been tampering with time, muddying the waters of history for his own purposes. Time itself is out of joint and the chief culprit is the enigmatic Doctor Knox. Somehow the Doctor and Evelyn must put history back on track before the future dissolves into chaos. But Knox, it turns out, may be the least of their worries...</p>

              <p>Starring Colin Baker<br />
              Featuring Eric Loren, Lysette Anthony and Leslie Phillips<br />
              With Maggie Stables as Evelyn (Duration: 120' Approx)</p>

              <p>"Robert Ross is an exceedingly nice man: affable, urbane, witty, exactly the sort of person you'd want to have to dinner. But beware! For beneath this charming exterior beats the heart of a deeply twisted man. Robert loves the macabre, that Ambrose Bierce world of gallows humour."<br />
              Barnaby Edwards, director. </p>

              <p><i>CHRONOLOGICAL PLACEMENT: This story takes place between the television adventures, The Trial of a Time Lord and Time and the Rani, and after the Big Finish audio adventure, 100.</i></p>
