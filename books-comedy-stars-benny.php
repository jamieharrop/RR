Feted for his unique brand of coy awareness, innuendo and saucy songs - but seemingly out of favour in his homeland before his death - Benny Hill can now be rated as having one of the foremost careers in comedy. His entire career is celebrated, through the pioneering television parodies for the BBC, the world-conquering Thames specials, film appearances including ‘Chitty Chitty Bang Bang’ and ‘The Italian Job’ and of course the number one hit single ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e1xvyTdBZI">Ernie, the Fastest Milkman in the West</a>’. This book is the ultimate guide to the most widely recognised funny man since Charlie Chaplin.  Includes exclusive memories from some of Benny's favourite colleagues including Henry McGee, Nicholas Parsons and director/producer Dennis Kirkland.</p>
