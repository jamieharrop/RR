          <p>Frankie Howerd’s comic genius made him a hero to the older generation and new wave comics alike. He remains one of our best-loved comedians, and his influence continues to grow.</p>

          <p>Frankie Howerd was the king of nudge-nudge humour, and this is the essential guide to his career. Detailing obscure and forgotten performances, alongside better-known highlights, like ‘Up Pompeii’, ‘The Ladykillers’ and ‘Carry On Doctor’. This book includes a definitive filmography and dozens of previously unpublished stills.  Foreword by Val Guest and Yolande Donlan.</p>
