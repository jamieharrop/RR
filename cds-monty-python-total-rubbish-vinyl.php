          <p>The *very* heavyweight Vinyl Edition collected all nine Monty Python U.K. albums in one lethally hefty box set. 'The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief' even recreates the original pioneering three-grooved release from 1973. The 7" 'Monty Python's Tiny Black Round Thing' is also included, along with the extensive and exclusive history of the recordings that I wrote, as told by the surviving Pythons and sound engineer Andre Jacquemin. The set also contains a voucher for expanded digital version MP3 downloads of the albums.</p>
