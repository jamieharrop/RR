          <p>A bumper two-disc selection of choice Williams tracks, culled from his West End appearances, ‘Round the Horne’ and numbers for the ‘Words and Music of Noel Coward’ album. Suitably enough actor David Benson, who has played both, performs the linking material that I wrote, as well as insightful extracts from the Kenneth Williams diaries.</p>
