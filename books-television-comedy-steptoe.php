          <p>A 50th anniversary celebration of arguably the best and most influential British situation comedy of all, this was written in collaboration with Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, alongside interviews with such guest stars as June Whitfield and Frank Thornton. Springing from a ‘Comedy Playhouse’ episode, ‘The Offer’, ‘Steptoe and Son’ ran for other ten years and spawned two feature films, a radio series and stage successes. The book details all of these, as well as the parallel careers of stars Wilfrid Brambell and Harry H. Corbett.   </p>
