          <p>From the dusty vaults of Pinewood Film Studios comes a mine of Carry On treasures - including over 100 never previously published photographs - which are revealed for the very first time. With access to the original scripts and the confidential censor’s notes, the book collates missing scenes, some of which featured some of the series’ best-loved stars. For the first time, script extracts and photographs recreate Terry Scott’s missing performance from ‘Carry On At Your Convenience’. Carry On Uncensored tells the unseen story of these comedy classics.  </p>
