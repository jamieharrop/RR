          <p><img src="images/books-sid-james-rebelh.jpg" class="alignright" />From when Sid James first arrived in England in 1946 he became the definitive "cockney" character actor in classic films for Hammer and Ealing Studios. This affectionate biography of the Carry On King reveals hitherto unpublished facts of both Sid's public and private life.</p>

          <p>At turns a devoted husband and voracious jack-the-lad, this book reveals every facet of his character through never-before-published correspondence with work colleagues, friends and agents, long forgotten press interviews and even extracts from the transcript of his ‘Desert Island Discs’. There are also exclusive tales from Sid’s inner circle including Carry On co-star Jim Dale, Sally Geeson who played his daughter in ‘Bless This House’ and scriptwriter Vince Powell, who created three sitcoms for Sid and made him a star of Thames Television. This revealing biography shows the actor’s many sides: even-tempered family man, war hero, tireless ladies’ man, reluctant broadcaster, shrewd investor, addicted gambler and saviour of Diana Dors! It will captivate anyone interested in learning more about this national treasure of comic acting.</p>

          <p>In 2013 I wrote <a href="http://www.comedy.co.uk/features/100_years_of_sid_james/">this Sid centenary piece</a> for the British Comedy Guide</p>
