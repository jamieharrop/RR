          <p>For over a decade Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie created the most imaginative, inventive and consistently hilarious television comedy around. Conquering the small screen, becoming groovy teenage pop icons and best-selling comic authors, The Goodies were a Seventies force to be reckoned with. After the last television series in 1982, The Goodies found renewed success as sitcom giant, off-the-wall medic and professional birder, but their individual and collective contribution to comedy history has largely gone uncelebrated. Until now! This book tells the entire story of three writer-performers who rejuvenated life into post-war Britcom. </p>

          <p>For the very first time, we delve deeply into the fascinating , enigmatic and just plain side-splittingly funny world of The Goodies. Each and every contribution of the three Goodies, together and apart, is credited. It's the ultimate salute to a comic force to treasure.</p>
