          <p>The Carry On films were the brainchild of Peter Rogers – one of the country’s most admired and respected film producers – and over thirty films were made during the series’ long and dazzlingly successful run. This is the first time that Rogers has broken his silence to tell his fascinating story. Mr. Carry On charts Peter Rogers’ illustrious career and marriage to Betty Box – the country’s first female producer who went on to make the Doctor film series – as well as documenting his forty-year partnership with director Gerald Thomas. This biography also dispels the popular myth of Rogers controlling the Carry On finances without joining in the fun. A treasure-trove of hitherto unpublished photographs is included, showing him cavorting on set with the stars, and he discloses an array of anecdotes concerning some of the nation’s best-known and best-loved comedy actors, including Sid James, Kenneth Williams and Hattie Jacques. </p>

          <p>Veteran producer Peter Rogers is the man behind the legendary Carry On... films. Thoroughly researched and containing a weath of new material and unseen photographs. It is an engaging insight into an enigmatic character's life and times, revealing the true story for the first time.</p>
