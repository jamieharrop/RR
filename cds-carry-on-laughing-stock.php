          <p>I sequenced and compiled this two-disc collection, as well as writing the extensive comedian profiles and track listings that form the rather lovely pull-out poster sleeve notes. Sid James, in his role as Vic Flange from Carry On Abroad, adorns the front cover and sings Our House, as featured in the stage show Carry On London!. Frankie Howerd, George Formby and Tony Hancock jostle for place alongside Max Miller, John Cleese and Tommy Cooper.</p>
