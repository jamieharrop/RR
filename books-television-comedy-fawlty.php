          <p>In the British Film Institute’s poll of the most important television programmes of the 20th century, Fawlty Towers was voted outright winner by the panel of actors, directors, producers, writers and critics. I was one of them. The series is now part of the national consciousness and, with repeat audience figures which hold the BBC2 record, the result was hardly surprising.</p>

          <p>Now for the first time, here is the definitive tribute to arguably the most hilarious six hours in television history. Contaning many unseen photographs and exclusive interviews with John Cleese, Prunella Scales and Andrew Sachs.</p>

          <p>Complete with full episode reviews and packed with more than 150 photographs, this is the ultimate guide to a comedy classic.</p>
