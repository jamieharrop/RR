          <p>As the official Monty Python press release put it: “On July 15, 2014 Monty Python’s classic 1989 album ‘Monty Python Sings’ will be reissued on Universal Music Enterprises. ‘Monty Python Sings (again) will hit the shelves during their series of highly anticipated Monty Python Live (mostly) shows at London’s O2 Arena, where they will be performing much of the classic material from the album. Released on two mastered CD formats (both including a 32-page booklet featuring lyrics plus notes by Robert Ross from new interviews with the Pythons), the new version of ‘Monty Python Sings (again)’ will contain brand new recordings, never-before-released gems from the Python archive and remixed Terry Gilliam cover artwork."</p>
