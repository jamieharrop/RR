          <p>An ambitious and definitive retrospective of Monty Python’s career in the recording studio, this collection gathered together all nine U.K. albums for the first time. ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, their debut album for the BBC, was united at last with the Charisma classics and beyond: ‘Another Monty Python Record’, ‘Monty Python’s Previous Record’, ‘The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief’, ‘Monty Python Live at Drury Lane’, ‘The Album of the Soundtrack of the Trailer of the Film of Monty Python and the Holy Grail’, ‘Monty Python’s Life of Brian’, ‘Monty Python’s Contractual Obligation Album’ and ‘Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life’. ‘Monty Python’s Tiny Black Round Thing’, the ultra-rare seven-inch flexi-disc from 1974, is included as a bonus. I compiled and wrote the lavish 64-page, casebound book that tells the indepth story of each of the albums included, with the help of new interviews with John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and sound engineer Andre Jacquemin.</p>
